Protocol Description	Human tonsils were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, incubated overnight in 30% sucrose at 4°C, embedded in tissue-tek O.C.T (Sakura) and stored at -80°C. Sections 5 µm in thickness were cut with a Leica CM 1850 UV cryomicrotome (Leica Microsystems).  Sections were stored at _80°C. 	Tissue sections were blocked with 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (Rockland) in PBS for 45 min at room temperature. After washing, the slides were incubated with metal-conjugated antibodies in PBS 0.5% BSA. Tissue sections were incubated with the antibody cocktail overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber, then washed several times in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS. Slides were rinsed in PBS and stained with DNA intercalator-Ir (Fluidigm, 1:2000 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were washed in distilled deionized water and air-dried for approximately 30 min. Slides were inserted into the Hyperion™ Imaging System (Fluidigm) for data acquisition.
